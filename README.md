This is from my project of a program that uses Huffman Coding for text compression. The program also has methods for file handling, and can read and write in files if provided by the user.
In a sample text of 500 words that I used, the compressed Huffman code was 48% the size of the original text.
The program can either encode text, decode any text provided with the key map values. 
When a text is encoded, the program output the Key map values or stores them in a file which is given by the user.
This project was written in Java, in the Visual Studio Code editor.
