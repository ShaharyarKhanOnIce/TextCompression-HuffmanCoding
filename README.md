This is from my project of a program that uses Huffman Coding for text compression. The program also has methods for file handling and can read and write in files if provided by the user.
In a sample text of 500 words that I used, the compressed Huffman code was 48% the size of the original text.
The program can either encode text or decode any text provided with the keymap values. 
When a text is encoded, the program outputs the Keymap values or stores them in a file that is given by the user.
This project was written entirely in Java.
